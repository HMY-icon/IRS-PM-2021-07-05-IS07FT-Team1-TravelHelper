## SECTION 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

Nowadays, traveling is becoming a more and more popular way for people to enjoy their life. To make the arrangement easier, various companies have released diverse applications to help users make decisions, such as Booking, TuNiu etc. Those applications have recommendation systems to recommend the best hotel or the best attraction  to the customers, and this recommendation function is now becoming popular among the users.
Our team found that the current travel apps on the market only recommend attractions and hotels based on the user’s geographic location and the user’s filtering criteria, and there are no interesting personalized recommendations. So we decided to design a web page app that helps customers plan their entire itinerary from the start, including travel locations, air tickets, hotels, attractions, etc. According to the customers' living habits, hobbies and other factors, we can help them plan the most suitable travel plan in every detail.
In our Travel Helper, there is not only an inference system, but even an NLP model we trained. They can help us give customers a better user experience and make itinerary more accurate and interesting.
